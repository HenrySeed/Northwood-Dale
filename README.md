# Northwood Dale

A text based adventure and game engine built in python.
Uses a text based interface with colors and clearing of display between frames.

It is designed to show the players location both on the minimap and also described in the main log. Showing side stats via the sidebar allows the main log to stay story-focussed.

Currently it includes a procedurally generated inventory on new game and a simple example dialogue.

The current to-do list is (in no particular order):
* [ ] Quest screen
* [ ] Navigation with a graph-based area system
* [ ] Combat mechanic
* [ ] Inventory management - pick up, drop, sell, etc
* [ ] Dialogue mechanic
