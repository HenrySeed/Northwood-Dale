##Homestead
Nestled near the river this large farmhouse looms over the flat 
plains as the only point on the horizon for miles. 
  
    To the North you can spot a lookout tower in the mountains
    To the West the road dips down to the river
    To the East the houses stables sit near a field for horses
    To the South the road leads into the horizon.

##Lookout Tower
Resting on the side of these mountain range is this lookout 
tower. It looks like it has the best view in the plains. You 
can see as far as the desert to the south of the homestead and 
you can see the giant tree on Kuldahar to the east. Far in the 
west the river snakes lazily across the plains. This high up you 
feel as though you can almost touch the heavens. You should 
probably head down before you fall. It's pretty precarious up 
here.
  
    To the South lies the path back to the Homestead
    On all other sides the mountain is too tough to climb.

##Homestead Stables
The stables sit near the homestead but there are no horses 
nearby, wonder where they all went? eh, nevermind, the owner 
probabley sold them. Nothing nefarious going on here.
  
    To the east sits Kuldahar, sitting under the mile high tree.
    Back towards the West sits the Homestead.
